Session & cookie-based authentication

Product & inventory management (CRUD)

Server-side rendering using EJS

Middleware usage (auth, validation, file upload)

File uploads using Multer

Clean and structured project setup

🧠 What I Learned

How MVC architecture works in real-world Node.js applications

Building protected routes using authentication middleware

Managing sessions and cookies securely

Structuring Express applications for scalability

Handling form validation and file uploads

Rendering dynamic data using EJS templates
